A blazingly fast, self-contained Rust reimplementation of the `uroman` universal romanizer.

## Overview

`uroman-rs` is a complete rewrite of the original `uroman` (Universal Romanizer) in Rust. It provides high-speed, accurate romanization for a vast number of languages and writing systems, faithfully reproducing the behavior of the original implementation.


## âœ¨ Features

*   **ðŸš€ Blazing Fast Performance**: Approximately **22 times faster** than the standard Python version, making it ideal for large-scale data processing. (See [Benchmark](#-benchmark))
*   **ðŸ“¦ Self-Contained**: A Pure Rust implementation with no dependency on external runtimes like Python or Perl. It compiles to a single, portable binary.
*   **ðŸŽ¯ High Fidelity**: A true drop-in replacement for the original `uroman`, passing its comprehensive test suite.
*   **ðŸ§° Rich Output Formats**: Supports multiple output formats, including simple strings (`str`), and structured JSON data with character offsets (`edges`), alternatives (`alts`), and all lattice paths (`lattice`).
*   **ðŸ”§ Versatile**: Use it as a standalone Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool or as a library in your own Rust applications.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can use `uroman` both as a command-line tool and as a library in your own projects.

### As a Command-Line Tool

To install the `uroman-rs` command-line tool, run the following:

```bash
cargo install uroman
```

This will install the executable as `uroman-rs` on your system.

### As a Library

To use `uroman` as a library, add it to your project's dependencies.

```bash
cargo add uroman
```

## ðŸš€ Benchmark

`uroman-rs` offers a dramatic performance improvement over the standard Python implementation. To provide a fair and robust comparison, we used the [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) benchmarking tool to measure the total execution time for a common task.

### Test Environment
*   **CPU**: [Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700]
*   **OS**: [WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04]
*   **Tool**: `hyperfine` v1.18.0
*   **Test File**: `multi-script.txt` from the original `uroman` repository.

### Results

| Implementation                | Mean Time (Â± Ïƒ)       | Performance                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **`uroman-rs` (This project)**| **99.3 ms Â± 3.6 ms**  | **~22x Faster**               |
| `uroman.py` (via `uv run`)    | **2180 ms Â± 26 ms** | Baseline                      |
